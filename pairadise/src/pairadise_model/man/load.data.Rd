\usage{
load.data(my.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{my.data}{Data frame containing grouped data to be analyzed.}
}
\value{
The function load.data returns a list containing the following entries:
\item{I1}{Group 1 isoform 1 counts for each replicate.}
\item{S1}{Group 1 isoform 2 counts for each replicate.}
\item{I2}{Group 2 isoform 1 counts for each replicate.}
\item{S2}{Group 2 isoform 2 counts for each replicate.}
\item{length_I}{Effective lengths of isoform 1.}
\item{length_S}{Effective lengths of isoform 2.}
\item{exonList}{IDs of the exons/events.}
\item{nExon}{Number of exons/events.}
\item{M}{Vector containing the number of replicates per exon/event.}
}
\description{
Loads the matched pair data to be analyzed by PAIRADISE.
}
\details{
The data frame has 7 columns, arranged as follows:
Column 1 contains the ID of the exons/events.
Column 2 contains counts of isoform 1 corresponding to the first group. 
Column 3 contains counts of isoform 2 corresponding to the first group. 
Column 4 contains counts of isoform 1 corresponding to the second group. 
Column 5 contains counts of isoform 2 corresponding to the second group. 
Replicates in columns 2-5 should be separated by commas, e.g. 1623,432,6 for three replicates.
Column 6 contains the effective length of isoform 1.
Column 7 contains the effective length of isoform 2.
